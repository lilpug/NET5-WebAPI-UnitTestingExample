# NET5-WebAPI-UnitTestingExample

This project is a basic NET 5 Web API REST project. The project has been development to help demonstrate
how unit testing and future adjustments can be done at ease using this type of structured approach.

## Unit Testing

The main startup.cs and program.cs files have been excluded from unit testing in this example. This has been done as 
these files only contain external code and are not what we have personally developed.

## Repository

The repository included in the project, is only a basic example but in a real world case. i would expect you to use 
whatever technology you require i.e. SQL Server, MySQL etc.
